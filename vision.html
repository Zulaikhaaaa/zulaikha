                    <p style="text-indent: 50px;">Currently, I want to focus on my university journey where 
                        I want to succesfully earn a diploma in Information Management and become an information 
                        scientist, working on providing focused information to scientific and technical research 
                        staff in industry, that make a positive impact on society. Moreover, I want to continue 
                        my study until master level for a higher position in the working field.</p>

                    <p style="text-indent: 50px;">In order to become a well-rounded individual who excels 
                        academically, practices good self-care, and contributes positively to my community, 
                        continuously evolving as a lifelong learner. I believe that I will become a socially 
                        responsible person, contributing to sustainable development and positive change.</p>
                    
                    <p style="text-indent: 50px;">I have great communication skills and the ability to persuade 
                        others. I will become a lecturer as it utilizes my skills and because I want to raise the 
                        voice of students. I have a piece of great knowledge of finance management too where I 
                        will open a consultancy business that will help small businesses efficiently utilize the 
                        available resources and become successful for part-time and full-time students. I plan to 
                        use my creative thinking and software development skills to develop an application that 
                        will benefit people in managing their day to day tasks.</p>
